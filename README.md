# bank-account

This is a project that I made in 2020 to help me learn object oriented programming in Python. It simulates a bank account where the user can create an account with a pin. They can 
  1. view their account (checking and savings)
  2. deposit money
  3. withdraw money
  4. transfer money from one account to the other
  5. wire transfer money
  6. view transaction history

There is also an executive account which has more benefits. It uses inheritance. The extra features are:
  1. claim rewards
  2. take a loan
